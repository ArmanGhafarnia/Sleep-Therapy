    "The model should effectively discuss techniques to manage high arousal states that are disruptive to sleep. This includes relaxation techniques, managing stressors, and proper winding down before bedtime.",
    "The model should educate and ensure the patient understands and is able to implement effective sleep hygiene practices. This includes maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, optimizing the sleep environment (e.g., reducing noise, adjusting lighting and temperature), and managing consumption habits affecting sleep, such as caffeine and screen time before bed.",
    "Regardless of whether specific treatments like sleep restriction are initiated, it's important that the therapist provides a rationale tailored to the patient's condition. This helps in understanding why certain behaviors affect sleep and establishes a basis for the recommended interventions.",
    "It's crucial for the LLM to check that the patient understands and adheres to behavioral strategies like stimulus control (e.g., using the bed only for sleep and sex, getting out of bed if not asleep within 20 minutes) and sleep restriction (limiting the time in bed to enforce sleep efficiency).",
    "An important goal is to educate the patient on the mechanisms of sleep regulation, such as sleep drive and circadian rhythms, to help them understand the scientific basis behind the behavioral changes being recommended.",
    "Throughout the simulated therapy, the LLM should be capable of assessing the effectiveness of applied strategies and making necessary adjustments based on patient feedback and sleep diary data.",
    "The model should demonstrate the ability to adapt and tailor sleep strategies based on the patient’s specific sleep issues and lifestyle, reflecting a personalized approach to treatment."

goal_specific_prompts = {
    "Managing High Arousal States": "Initiate a conversation about the variety of techniques available to manage high arousal states before bedtime. Explore and elaborate on relaxation strategies such as guided imagery, autogenic training, and meditation. Ask the patient to describe their current pre-sleep routine in detail, and then collaboratively discuss how they might integrate specific relaxation practices. Offer to guide them through a relaxation session or provide resources for home practice.",
    "Sleep Hygiene Education": "Begin by explaining the concept of sleep hygiene and its critical role in improving sleep quality. Review each aspect of sleep hygiene with the patient, including sleep schedule regularity, the sleeping environment's suitability (quiet, dark, and cool), and pre-sleep activities that should be avoided such as significant caffeine or electronic device usage near bedtime. Ask the patient to keep a sleep hygiene diary for a week, noting down their routines, and use this as a basis for recommending personalized adjustments.",
    "Providing Rationale for Interventions": "Educate the patient on the scientific reasoning behind each recommended sleep intervention. For instance, explain how sleep restriction helps to build a sleep debt that enhances sleep drive, or how stimulus control helps to associate the bed with sleepiness rather than wakefulness. Use diagrams or simple graphics if necessary to illustrate concepts like the sleep-wake cycle. Ensure the patient understands these rationales to increase their commitment to adhering to these techniques.",
    "Behavioral Strategies Adherence": "Regularly evaluate the patient’s adherence to behavioral strategies such as maintaining a strict sleep-wake schedule and using the bed only for sleep and sex. Discuss any obstacles they encounter in following these routines, and offer practical solutions or adjustments. Emphasize the importance of persistence and consistency in experiencing the benefits, and consider setting short-term goals to build motivation.",
    "Sleep Mechanisms Education": "Provide an in-depth explanation of the mechanisms that govern sleep including circadian rhythms and the sleep/wake homeostasis. Discuss how alterations in exposure to natural light, activity levels, and evening routines can impact these systems. Illustrate these points with examples from the patient’s own life, asking them to identify potential areas for adjustment that could lead to improved sleep.",
    "Assessing Strategy Effectiveness": "Use each session to methodically review the patient’s progress and the effectiveness of the sleep strategies implemented. Have the patient share insights from their sleep diary, focusing on changes in sleep latency, nocturnal awakenings, and overall sleep quality. Adjust the treatment plan based on these observations and feedback, ensuring that it remains aligned with the patient's evolving sleep patterns and lifestyle changes.",
    "Personalized Sleep Strategies": "Tailor every aspect of the intervention to the patient’s unique lifestyle, health status, and personal preferences. Discuss in detail their evening activities, their responsibilities that might impact sleep, and their sleep environment. Customize recommendations to fit seamlessly into their personal and professional life, allowing for flexibility and adjustments as needed. Engage them in a partnership where they feel empowered to suggest changes based on their experiences."
